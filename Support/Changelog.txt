Current Version: Public Release 1.4

	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 1.4:
	=======================================
	  * OSCCAL is now calibrated before any function involving the USART
	  * Removed the now unnessesary manual and auto calibration settings menu items
	  * Removed unused USART_TxString function
	  * EEPROM handling changed over to the (now M169 compatible) AVRLibC routines
	  * USART Rx interrupt moved to RingBuff.c and changed to the contents of the ringbuffer store routine for size/speed
	  * Fixed a few more dataflash glitches
	  * Moved the timeout setup function code to the TIMEOUT_TIMER_ON() macro
	  * Timeout system now uses Timer2, freeing up Timer1 for auto sleep
	  * Function parameters changed to const (where possible) for robustness
	  * Dataflash busy checking moved to a seperate routine for speed
	  * Added auto-powerdown with user settable timeout
	  * Correct command timeout error is now returned via the packet state machine instead of a command error
	  * Dataflash routines now make local copies of the SPI send routine pointer to save codespace and time

	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 1.3:
	=======================================
	  * PROGRAMMING DONE/FAIL messaged display code altered for smaller codesize
	  * Fixed EEPROM poll bug - now uses wait poll if last byte in page is the same as the poll value
	  * USI Timer0 compare match routine rewritten in optimised ASM for speed, increased USI max speed value
	  * USI Speed/Compare Value table reordered and blank EEPROM check removed for code size (due to table reorder code still defaults to fastest setting if the EEPROM is blank)
	  * Removed the WriteCollision flag from the USI driver, since the routine waits for completion before exiting anyway
	  * Re-added main menu option for storage info (accidentally removed in 1.2)
	  * Changed dataflash erase (external) method to the faster block erase, slow erase now performed after computer reply to prevent a timeout
	  * Fixed typo in CMD_READ_OSCCAL_ISP section of the ProgramManager.c packet interpretation routine
	  * External dataflash total pages table corrected
	  * Dataflash access speed increased to 4MHz (up from ~150KHz)
	  * System clock is now prescaled down to 1MHz inside the main menu to save power
	  * Removed unnessesary CopyFlashToBuffer command in ProgramManager.c
	  * Added code to exit OSCCAL faster if a value within the tollerace cannot be found (closest value used)

	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 1.2:
	=======================================
	  * PROGRAMMING DONE and PROGRAMMING FAIL messages are now shown for a longer time so they can be fully read
	  * DATAFLASH ERROR now also shown in PRGM DATAFLASH MODE if no attached dataflash is found
	  * ISP short detection routines removed for technical reasons
	  * Atmel LCD driver rewritten for size and speed

	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 1.1:
	=======================================
	  * PROGRAMMING DONE message changed so that it will show PROGRAMMING FAIL after an error
	  * Unnessesary clearing of invalid JoyStatus values removed
	  * Seperate external dataflash /CS pin removed, function integrated into slave AVR /RESET pin

	IN PUBLIC RELEASE 1.0:
	=======================================
	  * Fixed ISP short detection bug (always returning ISP short)
	  * ISP Short detection system now checks for Dataflash /CS short correctly
	  * Added SLEEP MODE option
	  * Fixed verify fail on large flash micros bug
	  * Added ButtTag functionality
	  * Added Storage sizes function
	  * Fixed dataflash mask address bug
	  * Fixed /RESET line not being released from hi-impeedance bug
	  * MAIN_IntToStr now forces null-termination of strings
	  * Extended address checking moved to a new subroutine; flag now cleared after command
	  * Interrupts now re-enabled while writing to EEPROM rather than after operation complete
	  * Packet timeout increased to slightly more than the computer timeout
	  * Added function to jump to the bootloader
	  * Programming of the data will not commence if no erase commands are in memory
